# Buildnumber

This program will search from the file at the selected path (default value: "buildnumber.h")
If the file is not present it will try to create it (return 1 -> can't create file) and put the default data

If the file is present it will search for the VER_MAJOR, VER_MINOR and BUILDNUMBER macros, will take the value. Increment BUILDNUMBER
When the value is not a number, replace it with zero.

If BUILDNUMBER exceeds 999 VER_MINOR is incremented and BUILDNUMBER is set to zero
If VER_MINOR exceeds 99 VER_MAJOR is incremented and VER_MINOR is set to zero
If VER_MAJOR exceeds 99 nothing is done and return 4
Then, regenerate the file:

    /* Generated by BuildNumber V2.0 */
