# Buildnumber

This program will search from the file at the selected path (default value: "buildnumber.h")
If the file is not present it will try to create it (return 1 -> can't create file) and put the default data

If the file is present it will search for the VER_MAJOR, VER_MINOR and VER_BUILD macros, will take the value. Increment VER_BUILD
When the value is not a number, replace it with zero
 
Then, regenerate the file:

    /* Generated by BuildNumber V2.0 */ 

    #ifndef BUILD_NUMBER_H
    #define BUILD_NUMBER_H

    #define BUILDNUMBER 1
    #define BUILDNUMBER_STR "001"
    #define VER_MAJOR 1
    #define VER_MINOR 0
    #define VERSION_STR "1.01.001"
    #define BUILDDATE_STR "4-12-2023 16:44:47"

    #endif
